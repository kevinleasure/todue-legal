  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="small">Effective: September 27, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>ToDue</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”)
    collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the ToDue mobile application
    (“ToDue” or the “App”).
  </p>

  <h2>1) What This Policy Covers</h2>
  <p>
    ToDue is a personal and group to-do app. The App runs on your device and can optionally sync
    data to our cloud service (if you choose to create an account and enable sync). This policy
    covers information handled by the App, our related services (including in-app purchases), and
    our support channels.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Information you provide</strong> (stored on-device and, if you enable sync, in our cloud):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Account profile: name, email, optional phone number, and an optional profile photo.</li>
    <li>Task and organizational content: task titles and notes, due dates, completion status,
        priorities, lists, groups, tags, and optional assignee names you enter.</li>
    <li>Group information: group names, group color selections, and member names you manually add
        (we do not import your device contacts unless you expressly enter or select a name).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Purchase &amp; subscription information</strong> (via Apple):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We use Apple’s StoreKit for purchases. Apple provides us limited transaction metadata
      (e.g., product ID, subscription status) so we can grant Pro access. We do not receive
      your full payment details.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>App and device diagnostics</strong> (typical for app operation):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>App version, device model, OS version, and basic diagnostics or crash logs (if enabled on your device)
        to improve reliability.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Notifications</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      ToDue uses local notifications to remind you about due tasks. Reminder content is generated
      on your device; we do not send your task data to a server just to create reminders.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) What We Don’t Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No device-wide address book import without your explicit action. Member names are only what you type or pick explicitly.</li>
    <li>No precise geolocation.</li>
    <li>No third-party advertising SDKs; we do not sell your data.</li>
    <li>No cross-app tracking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve the App’s core features (tasks, lists, groups, tags, reminders).</li>
    <li>Process and manage Pro subscriptions (via Apple StoreKit) and determine Pro entitlement.</li>
    <li>If you enable sync, store and deliver your data across devices and collaborators.</li>
    <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, troubleshoot, and comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Where Your Data Lives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On-device by default.</strong> ToDue stores your data locally on your device using Apple’s data storage frameworks.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Optional cloud sync.</strong> If you create an account and enable sync, your data will be
      stored on our cloud provider (e.g., Supabase or a comparable service) to enable multi-device access
      and collaboration. In that case, your data may be processed in the region where we provision our
      infrastructure. We will disclose the provider and region in the App or on our website when sync is available.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Sharing &amp; Disclosures</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We share information only as needed to operate and support the App:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple services:</strong> App Store, StoreKit (purchases), and Apple’s push/notification frameworks.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud infrastructure (if sync is enabled):</strong> to store and sync your data across devices and collaborators.</li>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> limited access under contract to operate, secure, and support the service.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal:</strong> to comply with applicable law, enforce our terms, or respond to lawful requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local-only mode:</strong> Use the App without creating an account; your data stays on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can enable or disable reminders in iOS Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; ToDue.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Access, correction, deletion:</strong> You can view and edit your data in the App.
      To request deletion of account/synced data or to receive a copy (export) of your cloud-stored data,
      contact us at <a href="mailto:ContactToDue@gmail.com">ContactToDue@gmail.com</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Uninstall:</strong> Deleting the App removes local data from your device. If you used cloud sync,
      also request account deletion so we can remove associated server data.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local data:</strong> retained on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cloud data (if enabled):</strong> retained while your account is active. On verified deletion requests,
      we delete or anonymize within a reasonable time, subject to backups and legal requirements.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information.
    Data in transit is encrypted using TLS when syncing. Local data benefits from iOS protections on your device.
    No system can be 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>10) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    ToDue is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction).
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us information,
    contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>11) Regional Notices</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>EEA/UK (GDPR):</strong> Our legal bases for processing may include performance of a contract (providing the App),
    legitimate interests (security, improvement), compliance with law, and consent (e.g., notifications). You may have rights
    to access, correct, delete, port, or restrict processing of your personal data. To exercise rights, contact
    <a href="mailto:ContactToDue@gmail.com">ContactToDue@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>California (CCPA/CPRA):</strong> We do not sell or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.
    California residents may request access or deletion of their personal information by contacting
    <a href="mailto:ContactToDue@gmail.com">ContactToDue@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>12) Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
  <p>
    Purchases are processed by Apple; refunds and subscription management are handled by Apple.
    The App may link to external pages (e.g., Terms, Privacy). Those sites have their own policies.
  </p>

  <h2>13) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Policy to reflect changes to the App or legal requirements.
    We will update the “Effective” date above and, when appropriate, provide in-app notice.
  </p>
